Import necessary libraries: The code first imports the required libraries. `numpy` is used for numerical operations, and `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model` is used to create a linear regression model.\\n\\n2. Define sample data: The code creates sample data for the independent variable `X` and the dependent variable `y`. In this case, `X` contains values `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `y` contains corresponding output values `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.\\n\\n3. Create a linear regression model: A linear regression model is created using the `LinearRegression()` function, which initializes an instance of the linear regression model.\\n\\n4. Fit the model to the data: The `fit()` method is used to train the model on the sample data. It learns the relationship between the input variable `X` and the output variable `y` to make predictions.\\n\\n5. Make a prediction: A new input value `X_new = 5` is created, and the `predict()` method is used to predict the output value (`y_pred`) based on the trained model. The predicted output is printed to the console.\\n\\nIn summary, this code demonstrates how to create a simple linear regression model, train it with sample data, and make predictions based on the learned relationship between the input and output variables.'"
